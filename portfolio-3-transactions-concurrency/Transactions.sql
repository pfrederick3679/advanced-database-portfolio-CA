-- Portfolio 3 commit/rollback exercise for pgAdmin Query Tool.
-- Run the sections separately as described in P3_pgAdmin_README.md.

-- SECTION A: select and run these statements together for the successful COMMIT.
BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

UPDATE portfolio.score
SET p3_processed_count = p3_processed_count + 1
WHERE score_id = 4001
RETURNING score_id, p3_processed_count;

-- SECTION B: select and run through the deliberately failing UPDATE.
-- The negative value should produce a check-constraint error (SQLSTATE 23514).
-- After the error, run ROLLBACK as a separate command (SECTION C).
